# Method that extracts a list of all API apps for the project:
def get_user_api_app_permissions(permission_lst):
    """A method that parses a permission set to extract a subset
    of API apps.

    The method iterates over a set of permission strings, usually extracted
    from a .get_permissions() method and removes every permission string that
    does not contain the substring "api". The use case for this function would
    be to get the list of API apps that a user or group has access to.

    The method contains very little type checking and assumes a specific data format
    that conforms to the outputs from django methods such as `user.get_user_permissions()`

    Example:
        user_permission = user.get_user_permissions() <-- {'sessions.add_session', 'finance_api.add_djiaindexcomposition'}
        api_permission = get_user_api_app_permissions(user_permission)

        api_permission <-- {'finance_api'}

    Arguments:
        permission_lst (set): A set of strings that typically contains permission string
            names. 
    
    Returns:
        set: The set containing only api app name.

    The method is meant to serve as a de-facto logging function for all incoming

    extracts features from the request parameter and creates an instance of the 
    api_log_database_model django model. This model instance is then saved to the database.
